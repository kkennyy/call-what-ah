# CLAUDE.md

Before doing any work in this repository:

1. Read `AGENT.md` fully.
2. Treat `AGENT.md` as the primary project instruction file.
3. Follow its product constraints, deterministic logic requirements, and testing workflow.

If any request conflicts with `AGENT.md`, call out the conflict and choose the safest deterministic implementation.
